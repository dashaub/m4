\begin{abstract}
Combination forecasting strategies have long been known to produce superior out-of-sample forecasting performance relative to even its best single component models. In the M4 forecasting competetion, this approach was harnessed to produce a very simple forecast combination strategy that achieved competetive performance on yearly time series. Moreover, the model fits very quickly, can easily scale horizontally with additional CPU cores or machines, and can very quickly and easily be implemented by users. This approach might be of particular interest to users who need accurate yearly forecasts without significant time, resources, or expertise to tune models. Users of the R statistical programming language can access this model in the "forecastHybrid" package.
