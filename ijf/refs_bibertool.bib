@ARTICLE{BatesGranter1969,
  ABSTRACT = {Two separate sets of forecasts of airline passenger data have been combined to form a composite set of forecasts. The main conclusion is that the composite set of forecasts can yield lower mean-square error than either of the original forecasts. Past errors of each of the original forecasts are used to determine the weights to attach to these two original forecasts in forming the combined forecasts, and different methods of deriving these weights are examined.},

@ARTICLE{GrangerRamanathan1984,
  ABSTRACT = {Abstract It is well known that a linear combination of forecasts can outperform individual forecasts. The common practice, however, is to obtain a weighted average of forecasts, with the weights adding up to unity. This paper considers three alternative approaches to obtaining linear combinations. It is shown that the best method is to add a constant term and not to constrain the weights to add to unity. These methods are tested with data on forecasts of quarterly hog prices, both within and out of sample. It is demonstrated that the optimum method proposed here is superior to the common practice of letting the weights add up to one.},
